# Equipment Checkout System (ECS)

This document provides instructions for installing, configuring, executing, and testing the Equipment Checkout System (ECS). It is intended for technical and end-user reference.

## Project Description
The **Equipment Checkout System (ECS)** is a Java-based desktop application developed to manage the lifecycle of equipment within GB Manufacturing. It enables authorized employees to efficiently borrow, return, order, and track equipment through a centralized system.

**Core features include**:

- **Checkout Equipment**: Allows employees to check out available equipment from warehouse inventory.

- **Return Equipment**: Provides employees the ability to return previously borrowed items. 

- **Order Equipment**: Enables maintenance employees to request required equipment for tasks.

- **Receive Reminders**: Notifies employees of upcoming or overdue equipment returns.

- **View Record**: Grants employees’ access to their transaction history and equipment usage records.

## REST API
The **ECS** now integrates with a **REST API** built with Spring Boot. This allows the desktop GUI to communicate with the server to handle operations such as checking out equipment and updating transactions in a modular way.

**Equipment Checkout Flow of Events**:

- Employee confirms their equipment checkout by pressing the **Yes** option

- CheckoutEquipment method is called from the ApiService (client-side) class with empID and equipmentID variables passed through

- ApiService class performs the following:
  
    - Creates an HTTP client to send requests
 
    - Builds a JSON payload using empID and equipmentID
 
    - Builds the HTTP POST request
 
    - Sends the POST request to API endpoint at /transactions/checkout
 
- REST controller named TransactionController receives the clients request and invokes the checkoutEquipment method from the service layer class named TransactionService
 
- The `TransactionController` (REST controller) receives the client’s request and invokes the `checkoutEquipment` method from the `TransactionService` class.

- The `TransactionService` processes the business logic:
   - Updates the equipment status to `Loaned`  
   - Inserts a new record into the `transaction` table with `borrowDate` and `expectedReturnDate`  

- The server responds with:
   - HTTP 200 (OK) if the operation is successful  
   - HTTP 500 (Internal Server Error) if the operation fails  

- The `TransactionController` sends the response back to the client.

- The `ApiService` receives the response, and the GUI displays a success or failure message to the user.
  
## Testing Support

The ECS project supports testing of all core features using JUnit 5 and an embedded H2 database, allowing each feature to be verified directly.

- JUnit 5 standalone JAR (`junit-platform-console-standalone-1.9.3.jar`) is included in the `/lib` folder of the repository, so no additional JUnit installation is required.
  
- Embedded H2 database (`h2-2.3.232.jar`) is included in the `/lib` folder for testing purposes.
  
- All JUnit annotations (`@Test`, `@BeforeEach`, `@AfterEach`, `@BeforeAll`, `@AfterAll`) and assertions (`assertEquals`, `assertNotNull`, etc.) are fully supported.

- Testing code located in the `test/ecsapplication/test` folder of the GitHub repository.

## Running Tests

Tests can be run directly in the Eclipse IDE with the following steps:

- Right-click the test case (e.g., `ReminderTest.java`)

- Click **Run As** JUnit Test

  <img width="588" height="23" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8ff55f6e-d27c-4154-83ec-78d8fde3e9dd" />

- Results of the JUnit tests can be directly verified through the Eclipse IDE:

  <img width="622" height="133" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dbd4fe4f-4e69-4419-8df4-53326acb76d4" />

- The H2 database will initialize automatically in memory.
  
  - No manual schema creation is required; the test setup creates and populates tables before each run.

  6. Repeat **steps 4** and **5** to view every Employee reminder

      >**Note**: The **Check Reminder** button must be pressed each time a new Employee is selected to display their reminders

      >**Tips**: If no reminder appears, ensure the SQL dump has been imported correctly

### Using the View Record Feature

  1. **Run** the ECS application

  2. Navigate to the **View Record** panel on the UI:

     <img width="882" height="392" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3e5da102-f219-47e3-9854-c4e7335c7048" />

     >**Note**: The **View Record** panel is active
